                <p>
                    My name is Paul Doheney and I have spent my 32 years of life in New England.  I grew up in Massachusetts and currently reside
                    in New Hampshire.  I attended University of Massachusetts at Amherst where I majored in Psychology.  After having worked in the Psych
                    industry for about 10 years now I am looking for a change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a few friends who are software engineers and so decided I wanted to switch careers to enter the Computer science industry.  I took a few introductory 
                    courses online to start out an get a feel for it as I had no background in coding or computers.  Now I am enrolled in Codecademy, and working on becoming a 
                    front-end engineer.  I find the work to be very fascinating and challenging which is a great change of pace to my previous career.  I hope to continue to grow and 
                    develop my skills so that I may enter the workforce and become a key memeber to whatever team I become a part of.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for such a drastic career change is I found work in the psych sector to be very emotionally draining and frustrating.  I worked in mental hospitals and
                    with children with autism at varying ages through to adulthood.  The work, although can be fulfilling at times when progress it made, often times left me with a sense
                    of hopelessness as we kept doing the same things to no avail.  That is why I have enjoyed my progress in the world of coding.  I find the work challenging but less in an 
                    emotional way like with psych but more in a mental way.  This is work I find fascinating and look forward to a career in this industry.
